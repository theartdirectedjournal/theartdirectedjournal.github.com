<section id="main">

<p class="intro">Here is my quick take on <a href="http://www.apple.com/live/2015-mar-event/">the Apple event</a> that was held this week.  As a <a href="http://theartdirectedjournal.com/Apple">reformed Apple fan</a>, my opinions about Apple products are somewhat biased.  Just keep that in mindâ€¦</p>

<p class="category">Apple TV</p>
<p>They dropped the price to $69, which is great, but the price drop is not enough to get me to purchase one, since I am a satisfied user of a Chromecast and a Roku, both of which are more capable devices.  Aside from HBO Now, which I will discuss in a moment, there is nothing compelling about the Apple TV.  However, I do recommend them for people who have a Mac, an iPhone and/or iPad, and purchase the majority of their movies and music from iTunes.</p>

<p class="category">HBO Now</p>
<p>As this is exclusive only to Apple (for the time being), and as a non-Apple TV (or iOS) user, I am not interested.  Even if it were available to other platforms, the $14.99 monthly price is no cheaper than what it would cost for me to add HBO to my existing satellite package and use HBO Go on my existing devices.  The only market this serves is the true cord cutters who don't already have a cable or satellite package.</p>

<p class="category">Macbook</p>
<p>The new Macbook is a very handsome machine.  Although the gold version is not my forte, the sleek lines and crisp display on this laptop are remarkable.  Much like the first generation Macbook Air, this new Macbook offers hints at where Apple is headed in terms of computer design.</p>  

<p>However, this product is not for me, as it us much too expensive for what you actually get. As a person who has grown to prefer Windows, Linux and Chrome OS and who loathes OS X Yosemite, there are many other lower cost options that can actually be upgraded and will not be out of date in a few years.  (And for those low cost options that will be out of date, well, you're not really out that much money.) As I understand it, there is absolutely no part of this new Macbook that can be cheaply upgraded.  The RAM is permanently attached to the logic board, as is the SSD.  Being able to upgrade such an expensive device is important to me because if it weren't for the ability to upgrade the RAM on my 2008 iMac, it would long have been a $1200 doorstop.  Plus, if you need to insert a USB drive, or attach a camera while the Macbook is charging, because there is only one USB C port, there is the need for an extra $80 adapter.  No thanks.  (Although if you are already dropping $1300 on a computer, what is another $80 for an adapter?)</p>

<p>Final Thoughts:  The new Macbook is pretty, but as the old adage says, looks are only skin deep.</p>

<p class="category">Apple Watch</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/live/2015-mar-event/">Edition</a> version of this product is a joke.  Clearly, with a price tag starting at $10,000, the Edition is targeted for fashion conscious people with an enormous amount of money to burn.  No matter how high end Apple is trying to make this watch, at the end of the day, that $10,000 watch is still a tech product that will be outdated in a year or two.  It must be noted that conspicuously absent from the event was any indication from Apple that there would be an upgrade path for this remarkably expensive device.  The price of a high end traditional watch can be justified.  If said watch is well cared for, it can be handed down for generations.  A device like the Apple Watch Edition cannot be handed down in the same way.  Sure the device itself will last, given Apple's reputation for build quality, but the software on said watch is another story.  Apple will inevitably stop supporting the first generation Edition with software and security updates at some point.  Apple does not have the long term software support track record to make me comfortable that they will support a device like the Edition over the long term.</p>  

<p>I predict that the best seller in the Apple Watch line will be the aluminum cased Sport version, as it sits at the lowest price point and looks just as good as its stainless steel (and more expensive) brother, the regular Apple Watch.</p>

<p>Subjectively, I find all versions of the Apple Watch to be a hideous abomination from a design standpoint.  Aside from the crown, the Apple Watch looks like a lazy copy of the Samsung Galaxy Gear.  In fact, the <a href="http://moto360.motorola.com/">Moto 360</a> looks more like something Apple would have designed than does the Apple Watch.  For a firm that is so design conscious, I am truly surprised by the design of the Apple Watch.  Its user interface also leaves something to be desired, but keep in mind that I prefer the clean, Modern design from Microsoft and the Material Design elements championed by Google.</p>

<p>Oh well. To each his own.</p>
