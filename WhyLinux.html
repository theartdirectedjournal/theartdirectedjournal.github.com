<p class="bold_statement">TL;DR - I have switched to Linux as my primary operating system, and don’t plan to switch back any time soon.</p>

<p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>hile I have used Linux for roughly 13 years, primarily as a dual booted, secondary operating system, as well as in a VM (Kali, and before that Backtrack), and although there was a pretty good chunk of time that I did use a Chromebook (Cr48) as my daily driver, I have never fully committed to making Linux my primary operating system.  I really like Linux.  I like the philosophy behind it (and open source software).  I like that if I don’t like one particular Linux distro, there is another just waiting for me to try.  I like that it is free (as in beer).  I also like that it runs well on older hardware, is constantly updated, and it is reasonably secure (at least more so in my opinion than Windows or Mac OS).  Most importantly, I really want to commit to fully learning Linux, and what better way to fully learn something than to jump in head first.  So, a few months ago, I completely wiped Windows from the my laptop’s hard disk, and I have been using Linux as my daily driver ever since.</p>

<p class="bold_statement">A little backstory on selecting a distro...</p>

<p>In the roughly two years since I got my current laptop, I have been hopping between Ubuntu LTS (long term support), Fedora, OpenSuse, Arch (<a href="https://antergos.com">Antergos</a>), Elementary OS, and Ubuntu Gnome, alongside Windows 10.  I prefer Debian-based distros (like Ubuntu) over RPM-based distros (like Fedora and Suse).  Although I used Fedora 24 for a while, Fedora 25 and 26, on my particular laptop, had too many networking bugs.  I want to use the computer, not troubleshoot why my wifi speeds are slow.  I felt Suse was too bloated.  Antergos was nice, but I had issues with the trackpad on my particular laptop that I could not get resolved.</p>

<p>With that in mind, when I decided to go all in with Linux, I chose Ubuntu 16.04 LTS as my distro of choice.  Ubuntu (and yes, I’m currently using their default (<a href="https://insights.ubuntu.com/2017/04/05/growing-ubuntu-for-cloud-and-iot-rather-than-phone-and-convergence/">for now</a>) Unity desktop environment) is fast and responsive on my laptop.  Everything worked right out of the gate.  There were no driver issues. The sound and the volume up, down and mute keys on the keyboard worked properly.  Wifi works as it should.  In fact, the trackpad is so much more responsive and fluid on Ubuntu than it ever was on Windows.  Where other Linux distros gave me trouble with two finger scrolling and tap to click, Ubuntu did not.  My XBox One controller even works with no special tinkering on my part. (On my iMac, where, according to Apple's marketing, things are just supposed to work, I had to install a third party utility to get my XBox One controller working.)  Yes, some consider Ubuntu the distro for noobs.  Noob distro or not, it is still very powerful, and it does everything I need it to do.</p>

<p class="bold_statement">So Linux is installed.  Now what?</p>

<p>First and foremost, there is a huge performance increase with Ubuntu vs Windows. This is not new to me, since I had been dual booting for quite some time.  But I feel it worth noting, especially for those who have only used Linux in a VM, that my laptop simply feels faster, and it uses measurably fewer CPU cycles and less RAM.</p>

<p>While I’m very fond of using the terminal, it must be noted that one no longer needs extensive knowledge of the command line in order to use Linux. On most of the mainstream distros, things like updates and the installation of software happen through the user interface (although I update via the command line).  In fact, most of the mainstream distros also come with a built in app store.  In terms of software, everything that I was using on Windows is available to me on Linux. In terms of name brand, third party software, I use Citrix Receiver for occasional work related purposes. I am using Google Chrome as my default browser, and I have Spotify installed for music.  I am also using Steam for games. While Microsoft Office is not available on Linux, the powerful Libre Office suite is pre installed.  (Full disclosure:  I am actually a huge fan of Microsoft Excel and use its advanced features in my day job.  However, for personal use, I use Google Docs and Sheets pretty much exclusively.). I also use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor on Linux.  I like it, and it works.  I don't do a lot of photo or video editing on my laptop.  That said, it must be noted that video editing on Linux may be an issue for some.  Adobe has yet to port their apps over to Linux.  If you need Adobe software, I recommend sticking with Windows or a Mac.  However, for me, GIMP works quite nicely for photo editing.</p>

<p class="bold_statement">So what makes Linux so great?</p>

<p>For the record, I do not hate Microsoft or Apple, nor do I hate Windows 10 or Mac OS.  I do not mean this to be a diatribe against their products.  Microsoft and Apple employ a lot of smart people, and I do believe that these two companies do in fact want to give their customers a good experience.  It must also be noted that I was (and still am) a fan of Windows Phone and Windows 10 Mobile.  While I am an Android guy at heart, I happily used both a Windows Phone and a phone running Windows 10 Mobile for quite some time.  (Windows 10 Mobile was actually a very good operating system, and I am very sad about Microsoft’s retreat from the Mobile space. But that is a topic for another day.)  That said, the fact of the matter is that in a lot of ways, Linux gets a lot of key things right, at least for me.
</p>

<p>For starters, there is the privacy factor.  While Apple does a stand up job when it comes to consumer privacy, there is a lot of noise (some of it fear, uncertainty and doubt and some it of legitimate) that has been made over the amount of data that Windows 10 sends back home to Microsoft.  I can certainly understand for those that are on the Windows Insider Program (which I participated in, both on mobile and desktop and is <i>entirely</i> optional) why Microsoft would require so much telemetry data from their users, but it annoys me that one cannot completely opt out of sending telemetry data to Microsoft if they are on the standard, production builds of Windows 10.  On my copy of Ubuntu, I choose not to send any telemetry back to Canonical (Ubuntu’s parent company), and as far as I can determine, no data is being sent in that regard.</p>

<p>While Microsoft has done a phenomenal job of better securing Windows over the years, the fact that Windows 10 Home does not come with a full disk encryption solution out of the box bothers me.  Full disk encryption is essential on a laptop, as they can be easily lost or stolen.  To get Bitlocker, Microsoft's Enterprise grade full disk encryption solution, one needs to be running Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise.  There is a disk encryption option available for laptops and tablets that come with Windows 10 Home pre installed, but from what I understand, <a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/12/28/recently-bought-a-windows-computer-microsoft-probably-has-your-encryption-key/?comments=1#comments">the encryption keys are actually stored on OneDrive</a>.  Nevertheless, on my laptop, which took advantage of the &ldquo;free&rdquo; upgrade to Windows 10 Home, full disk encryption of any type is out of the question.  As a note, there are third party solutions such as VeraCrypt that could be used to fully encrypt the disk on a device running Windows 10 Home.  However on Linux, I am taking advantage of native full disk encryption, and my encryption key is not stored in the cloud.</p>
    
<p>Software updates are important, not so much to get the latest and greatest features, but moreso to get the latest security updates and bug fixes.  Unfortunately, both Apple and Microsoft have been known to leave their users out in the cold, with no path to update their systems.  I understand that time marches on, systems get old and outdated, and inevitably, all devices must at some point face obsolescence.  This happened to me with my 2008 iMac, but this has happened to others, even with semi-current devices on Windows 10.  There <a href="http://bgr.com/2017/07/20/windows-10-creators-update-issues/">have been cases</a> where a device worked just fine with one Windows 10 version, where the next version of Windows 10 was no longer supported.  One generally will not face this problem using Linux.  There are current, up to date Linux distros that support just about every type of hardware imaginable.  Also, I must not neglect to mention that operating system updates happen much faster on Linux than they do on Windows.  Furthermore, with Linux, most updates do not require a reboot.</p>
    
<p>Linux also offers a great degree of customizability.  For those that want to tinker with their systems down to the most minute details, Linux provides that ability.  However, for those who just want to use their system without loads of customization, Linux (specifically Ubuntu with the Unity desktop or any Linux distro that runs <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a>) provides sensible defaults.</p>

<p class="bold_statement">There are still some gaps.</p>

<p>Even though I have switched to Linux full time, there are still a few instaces where I have needed to use Windows.  My current phone, a Nextbit Robin, is by design easily able to run custom ROMs.  Unlocking the bootloader and installing a custom recovery on the Robin is a trivial task using Linux.  However, after using both <a href="https://www.lineageos.org/">Lineage OS</a> and <a href="http://paranoidandroid.co/">Paranoid Android</a>, I decided that I wanted to switch back to the stock ROM for a while (primarily for working Android Pay functionality).  In order to do this, the recovery files and scripts that Razor/Nextbit provides to flash the device back to stock only work on Windows and Mac.</p>

<p>There is also the case of the <a href="https://home.cricut.com/">Cricut</a>.  This past weekend, my wife and I tried to use my laptop to run the Cricut.  Unfortunately, the proprietary Cricut drivers that are necessary to send the files from the laptop to the Cricut, even through the Cricut design program itself is web based and accessed via a browser, only work on Windows or a Mac.</p>

<p>Aside from these two issues, the switch has so far been a success, and I am planning to continue using Linux as my primary operating system for the foreseeable future.  </p>
