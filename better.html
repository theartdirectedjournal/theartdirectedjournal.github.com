<p>This past fall, we saw "The Odd Life of Timothy Green". It is an excellent movie.  I highly recommend it.</p>

<p>What really struck me about this movie was the positive attitude that Timothy (the main character) displayed.  As an example, in what was one of my favorite scenes in the movie, Timothy was trying out for soccer.  He twice tried to kick the ball for a penalty shot, and both times, instead of kicking the ball, he tripped over the ball and fell down.  When he got up after the second penalty kick attempt, he was grinning from ear to ear, and the coach asked Timothy what he was smiling about.  Timothy responded with, "I can only get better".</p>  

<p>What a fantastic attitude to have!  If we all had this attitude, just think about what we could accomplish.  It reminded me that I need to choose to think positively.</p>
