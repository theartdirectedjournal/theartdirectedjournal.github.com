       	<h1>The Thankfulness Project</h1>
    
        <p class="when">Monday, April 27, 2015</p>
        <p>Just coming out of a rather rainy weekend, today is one of those days when I would just rather be outside.  Oh well.  Responsibilitiy prevails.  However, I am thankful for the beautiful weather on days like today - a nice mix of blue sky and a few clouds, similar to <a href="https://flic.kr/p/sjwa8K">this</a>.</p>
    
        <p class="when">Tuesday, April 14, 2015 &mdash; Sunday, April 26, 2015</p>
        <p>I have had a lot of things to be thankful for, but I have just not had the time to write about them.  Some things that immediately come to mind:  my family, the NBA playoffs (go Bulls!), warm weather, and my wife (a recurring theme).  She is a stay-at-home mom, and I think that what they do often goes unnoticed and unappreciated by many, when in fact, they really are the CEOs of their respective families.  Thanks, B, for everything you do!</p> 
    
        <p class="when">Monday, April 13, 2015</p>
        <p>I cannot remember where this quote came from, but I have been thinking about it a lot lately. &ldquo;But by the grace of God go I.&rdquo;</p>
    
        <p class="when">Sunday, April 12, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful that I was able to resolve the issue I had with the lights on my stairs with a simple replacement of the downstairs light switch.  I am also thankful that steaks on the grill at home actually cost less (and are much healthier and taste better) than taking the whole family out to McDonalds.</p>
    
        <p class="when">Saturday, April 11, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful for being able to grill out with friends.</p>
    
        <p class="when">Friday, April 10, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful for modern medical technology and date nights with my wife.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Thursday, April 9, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful that the cost of what I call &ldquo;good enough computing&rdquo; has exponentially decreased.  For example, for the cost of an <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/buy-watch/apple-watch?product=MJ3V2LL/A&step=detail#">Apple Watch</a> ($600), you could buy a <a href="http://moto360.motorola.com/">Moto 360</a> ($250), a <a href="http://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones/moto-e-2nd-gen/moto-e-2nd-gen.html">Moto E</a> ($150) and an <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/HP-Stream-11-Signature-Edition-Laptop/productID.309174400">HP Stream 11</a> ($200).</p>
       	
       	<p class="when">Wednesday, April 8, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful that the grass we planted a few weeks ago is finally starting to grow.</p>
       	
       	<p class="when">Sunday, March 29, 2015 &mdash; Tuesday, April 7, 2015</p>
        <p>Sometimes life is busy. I had a business trip to Texas, immediately followed by a family vacation to Washington, D.C.  I am thankful that the business trip went well, we had a lot of fun in D.C. and that we are now home safe.  Now I'm tired.  I need a vacation from my vacation.  :-)</p>

		<p class="when">Saturday, March 28, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful for cookouts.  To celebrate Luke's birthday, we had a cookout with my parents, my sister, one of Luke's friends, and Luke's cousins.  A good time was had by all.</p>

        <p class="when">Friday, March 27, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful for the invention of the text message.</p>

        <p class="when">Thursday, March 26, 2015</>
		<p>I am thankful that Brandy and I have the privilege of being Luke's parents.  Happy 10th birthday, Luke.  You are one amazing kid.</p>

        <p class="when">Wednesday, March 25, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful for God's grace and yet another day.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Tuesday, March 24, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful for my home.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Monday, March 23, 2015</p>
        <p>I am once again thankful for my beautiful wife and all that she does.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Sunday, March 22, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful that my son returned safely from his trip.</p>

        <p class="when">Saturday, March 21, 2015</p>
        <p>I am thankful for a day of great weather.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Friday, March 20, 2015</p>
		<p>My son left this afternoon on an overnight trip with the youth group at our church.  I am thankful that they arrived safely at their destination.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Thursday, March 19, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for <a href="http://www.android.com">Android</a>.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Wednesday, March 18, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful that even though he is not a basketball player, my oldest son found a sport (football) that he is good at and that he loves.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Tuesday, March 17, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for the game of basketball.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Monday, March 16, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for curvy, country roads and a car that handles well.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Sunday, March 15, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for the lessons learned in life group.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Saturday, March 14, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for music, even for the songs that get stuck in your head and give you a song headache.</p>
       	     	
       	<p class="when">Friday, March 13, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for beautiful sunrises like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sfbest-23/16802289005/in/set-72157650084401605">this one</a>.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Thursday, March 12, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for my kids, Nick, Luke and Olivia.  Each one of them has different things about them that make them great.  I am grateful to be their dad.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Wednesday, March 11, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for my wife.  She is awesome, and I really appreciate all that she does.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Tuesday, March 10, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for the warmer weather.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Monday, March 9, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful for daylight savings and the extra hours of light if brings.</p>
		
		<p class="when">Sunday, March 8, 2015</p>
		<p>I am thankful that God loved the world enough that he gave his son, Jesus.  For whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  (John 3:16)  I am thankful that this gift is for <i>everyone</i>.  Not those he "chooses", but for everyone who chooses Him.</p>
