<h1>Now You're Playing with Power</h1> 

<div id="text">
  <p>Nintendo, along with other licensed third parties, created a multitude of accessories for the NES during its reign as the most popular game console in the late 80&#8217;s and early 90&#8217;s.  I fondly recall accessories such as the Zapper, the track pad, wireless controllers (which did not live up to all the hype), and of course, the Game Genie.  My favorite of all of these accessories, however, was the NES Advantage.</p>

	<p>The NES Advantage was Nintendo&#8217;s way of bringing the feel of arcade gaming into the home. The Advantage was well made, and the joy stick and buttons had a nice, sturdy feel to them.  Mine still works flawlessly today.</p>

	<p>Aside from the novelty of a real joystick, the Advantage really did give one an &#8220;advantage&#8221;, through the inclusion of two &#8220;turbo&#8221; buttons (along with knobs to adjust them) and a slow motion button.  Along with most kids during my generation, I loved these features.</p>
