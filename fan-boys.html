<p class="title">Fan Boys</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWtVhoOkBfw">Tech Altar</a> recently put out a great video titled, &ldquo;How to Cure a Fan Boy&rdquo; as a part of his fantastic &ldquo;The Story Behind&rdquo; series. In this video, he challenged the viewer to share three things they liked about the big three players in the tech industry: Apple, Google and Microsoft (at least big 3 in terms of operating systems).  Given that I have not posted in about a year and given that I thought it sounded like a fun excercise, I thought I would share mine.</p>

<p class="sub-title">Microsoft</p>

<p>They tend to support their products for a long time (XP lasted 14 years, after all). Of the three companies, they are truly the most innovative right now.  (However, much of that innovation could be credited to their current underdog position in terms of mobility and mind share). Cortana is an awesome assistant. I would like to see Microsoft further improve the AI, and I would like to see Cortana come to more devices. The way that Cortana integrates with Bluetooth, especially with regards to responding to text messages, etc. is second to none.</p>

<p>However, I do not like what they have done with Windows phone (and Windows 10 Mobile) in terms their <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/29/technology/microsoft-layoffs-july-jobs/">&ldquo;retrenchment&rdquo;</a>. I believe that they did not anticipate (or maybe they did) that other OEMs would not fill in the gap left behind when Microsoft all but pulled the Lumia line from the market. Hopefully Windows 10 on ARM for future mobile devices will make Microsoft a dominant force in the mobile space again.</p>

<p>In late March 2016, in order to try out Windows 10 Mobile on a proper device that was actually designed for that OS and because that I had grown a bit bored with Android at the time, I purchased an Alcatel OneTouch Fierce XL.  I really like this phone, and I like Windows 10 Mobile.  However, as of the time of this writing, I have gone back to my 2013 Moto G, which now runs Lineage OS (Android 7.1).  While for the most part the &ldquo;app gap&rdquo; does not bother me, there are a few key apps, like My Fitness Pal, that I really need.  I sincerely hope that Windows 10 on ARM solves these issues.  If Microsoft ever comes out with a truly innovative first party phone that runs full Windows 10, I may jump at the chance to buy one.  Until then, it's Android for me.</p>

<p class="sub-title">Apple</p>

<p>I like the fit and finish of their products. My wife's iPhone 7 is second to none in terms of build quality and camera. Apple products do, in most cases, "just work", provided that you don't like to tinker too much.</p>

<p>However, I don't appreciate their support model (speaking specifically about how long they support Mac OS) nor do I appreciate their high prices. I feel that there is tech on the market that performs just as well, that can be had for much cheaper.  The OnePlus 3 is the perfect example of that.  Anecdotally speaking, I have a perfectly good iMac from 2008, and the machine still runs flawlessly, aside from the fact that the latest supported OS is bloated and makes my once fast iMac incredibly slow and the fact that they will stop supporting that last version of OS X that is able to run on it (securely) soon.  The great news is that Linux runs great on this device, so its life is far from over.</p>

<p class="sub-title">Google</p>

<p>I appreciate their web based tools and innovations. They are hands down better than anything Apple or Microsoft offers. Yes, full MS Office does a lot, but for 90% of folks, Docs and Sheets work just fine. I also like the Chromebook initiative.  They are great, secure, low cost machines that work for 90% of the folks out there.  They are great in the education space and great for folks who just need a laptop to surf the web and Facebook. In that vein, I also like that they allow Android to run on devices of all shapes, sizes and price ranges. I like that fact that while they do collect a lot of data, they have generally been pretty transparent about what they have and how they secure it.</p>

<p>However, I do not care for the Pixel phones and would really like to see them bring the best of Android and Chrome OS and finally merge them into one universal operating system, similar to what Microsoft is doing with Windows. The mess that is Android updates continues to frustrate me, as I would love to see them take more ownership of the situation with carriers and OEMs than they have. Lastly, their issues with working on Microsoft devices frustrates me. Currently, Google contacts will not sync with my Windows devices (PC and phone), and it is one of the reasons I have moved back to Android.</p>

<p>So there you have it.  Just a few of my thoughts on each of the big three.  I would like to know your thoughts.*</p>
