<p class="caseytitle">Casey at the Bat</p>

<p class="caseysubtitle">by Ernest Lawrence Thayer</p>

<p>The outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day:<br />
The score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play,<br />
And then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,<br />
A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game.</p>

<p>A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest<br />
Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast;<br />
They thought, "If only Casey could but get a whack at that—<br />
We'd put up even money now, with Casey at the bat."</p>

<p>But Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,<br />
And the former was a hoodoo, while the latter was a cake;<br />
So upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,<br />
For there seemed but little chance of Casey getting to the bat</p>

<p>But Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,<br />
And Blake, the much despisèd, tore the cover off the ball;<br />
And when the dust had lifted, and men saw what had occurred,<br />
There was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.</p>

<p>Then from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;<br />
It rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;<br />
It pounded on the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,<br />
For Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat</p>

<p>There was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;<br />
There was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile lit Casey's face.<br />
And when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,<br />
No stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat</p>

<p>Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;<br />
Five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;<br />
Then while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,<br />
Defiance flashed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.</p>

<p>And now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,<br />
And Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.<br />
Close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped—<br />
"That ain't my style," said Casey. "Strike one!" the umpire said.</p>

<p>From the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,<br />
Like the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore;<br />
"Kill him! Kill the umpire!" shouted someone on the stand;<br />
And it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.</p>

<p>With a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;<br />
He stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;<br />
He signaled to the pitcher, and once more the dun sphere flew;<br />
But Casey still ignored it and the umpire said, "Strike two!"</p>

<p>"Fraud!" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered "Fraud!"<br />
But one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.<br />
They saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,<br />
And they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.</p>

<p>The sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate,<br />
He pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;<br />
And now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,<br />
And now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.</p>

<p>Oh, somewhere in this favoured land the sun is shining bright,<br />
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;<br />
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout,<br />
But there is no joy in Mudville—mighty Casey has struck out.</p>
