<p class="article_title">My iOS Workflow</p>

<p>As I mentioned in a <a href="http://theartdirectedjournal.github.io/battle-of-the-text-editors.html">previous article</a> I do most of my writing (and coding) on my iPhone.  It is is my favorite and most used computer.  I thought I would share a few things I do in terms of workflow and apps when it comes to publishing to this site.</p>

<p>Most articles start out life in <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/iphone/">iA Writer</a> or the stock iOS Notes app. If the article starts out as a quick idea that came to me at the spur of the moment, the article starts out in Notes. Notes opens quickly, and because of how fast it is, it is my ubiquitous capture app.  If the article is something I have been thinking about for a while, it will start out in iA Writer.  Either way, the outline of the article will make its way into iA Writer eventually.</p>

<p>I usually finish the article in iA Writer and all editing is done in this app.  iA Writer is a fantastic plain text editor, and the onscreen keyboard within the app has a few features, such as a top toolbar with frequently used symbols and arrow keys that make editing an easy task. Once the article is written, it is time to design.  Most articles for this site are "art directed", where each article has a unique design. For more short form articles, I have a standard template that is responsive (which this article uses).  For the longer form art directed posts, I have a starter template in iA Writer that has the bare bones of an HTML structure already there.  I copy that code into a new document in iA Writer (select all, copy as plaintext).  I then save that document and open the draft article I just completed.  I then select all and copy as HTML, and then paste it into my newly created art directed template.</p>

<p>Once everything is copied and pasted in, I then go about the design process.  I try to design each article around the content.  Once the design is complete, I then copy the whole thing as plain text, open Safari and navigate to GitHub, create a new file there (usually article-title.html), and paste my code in and hit save.</p>

<p>There you have it. Except for the most complicated designs, most articles can be designed on the iPhone by using this simple workflow.</p>
