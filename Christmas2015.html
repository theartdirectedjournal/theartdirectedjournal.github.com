<h1>Christmas 2015</h1>

<p>Each year, I write a Christmas post, the theme of each centering around my belief that Jesus Christ is the &ldquo;real reason for the season&rdquo;.  If you are so inclined, you can see the one from 2012 <a href="http://theartdirectedjournal.github.io/christmas.html">here</a>, the one from 2013 <a href="http://theartdirectedjournal.github.io/thegreatestgift">here</a>, and the one from 2014 <a href="http://theartdirectedjournal.github.io/reason-for-the-season">here</a>.  As I set out to craft this year's Christmas post, one theme kept racing through my mind &mdash; simplicity.   I wish Christmas were still simple. Instead, it seems as though Christmas has become complicated and overly commercialized. As such, I thought it fitting that this year, my Christmas post should take things back to the bare basics, just plain old HTML &mdash; The story of our Savior's birth in its simplest form.  Any person with a web browser, no matter how old that browser is, can read the good news.  No styling, no JavaScript, just plain old text on screen.</p>

<h2>Luke 2</h2>

<p><i>1</i> In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. <i>2</i> (This was the first census that took place while[a] Quirinius was governor of Syria.) <i>3</i> And everyone went to their own town to register.</p>

<p><i>4</i> So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. <i>5</i> He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. <i>6</i> While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, <i>7</i> and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.</p>

<p><i>8</i> And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. <i>9</i> An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. <i>10</i> But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. <i>11</i> Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. <i>12</i> This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”</p>

<p><i>13</i> Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,</p>

<p><i>14</i> &ldquo;Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>15</i> When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, &ldquo;Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>16</i> So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. <i>17</i> When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, <i>18</i> and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. <i>19</i> But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. <i>20</i> The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.</p>
