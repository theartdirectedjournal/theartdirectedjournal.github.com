<p class="title">Rethinking My Apps and Home Screen</p>

<p>I have always been interested in seeing other's iPhone (and Android) home screens, and I have at times in the past put a lot of thought into my own.  Over time my own home screen (and second, third and fourth screens) would inevitably become cluttered with all sorts of apps and folders of apps that I no longer needed or used.  I would clean it all up and have a newly organized iPhone for a short time, only to clutter it up again.  I have repeated this cycle more than I would like to admit.</p>

<p>The last time that this happened, I had countless games that I had downloaded, tried and lost interest in (like Song Pop and Draw Something and Candy Crush).  I also had many apps with duplicate functionality taking up my limited 8GB of space.  For instance, how many music streaming apps did I really need?  I could choose between Songza, Spotify, Pandora, Stitcher Radio, NPR and iHeart Radio, just to name a few. Furthermore, how many email clients did I really need?  At one point I had installed and was actively using GMail's official app, Sparrow, Mailbox and the stock iOS mail app. (I was planning to write a comparison article that never panned out.)</p>

<p>There were also the text editors and note taking apps: iA Writer, Simplenote, the stock Notes app, Google Drive, Plaintext, Evernote, and Microsoft OneNote.  In addition, I had multiple weather apps, including Forecast, the Weather Channel, and Yahoo!'s new weather app. I had also installed Sketchbook, Ink, and a few other drawing apps, as well as the Roku app, Time Warner Cable, HBO Go, YouTube, Crackle and Netflix.  The kicker was that I rarely used my phone for any of those video apps.</p>

<p>The madness had to stop.  I had gotten to the point where I never could remember in which app I put what where.  I remember thinking, "Geez, did I make that note with the Notes app or Simplenote, or maybe it was buried  in Dropbox because I had used iAWriter?"  I once remember having only about 100MB free between all my music (I also felt compelled to store as much music as I could on my phone) and all these apps and their data, and I was absolutely sick of the cluttered look of my phone's various screens.  Did I put Google+ in my "Social" folder on the third screen, or was it somewhere else? I had gotten to the point where using my phone was no longer an enjoyable experience. Something had to change.</p>

</section>

<p>The Ground Rules</p>
<p>I decided to take a mental inventory of the apps I actually used and preferred, and I set out to transform my phone back into something I actually liked to use.  First I set up some ground rules:</p>

<ol><li>If one of Apple's native iOS apps fit the bill, I would use that. I like most of Apple's stock apps in terms of how they work and their simplicity.  Plus, they were designed by Apple, who has the deepest inside knowledge of the inner workings if iOS, and as a result most of those apps load fast, are stable, and are very responsive.
</li></ol>
<ol><li>If one of Apple's native apps would not fit the bill, I would use a web app.  I love the openness of the web, and I feel that is the future.  <a href="http://forecast.io">Forecast</a> is an example of a spectacular web app.  If there was no suitable web app, I would use a third party app from the App Store.
</li></ol>
<ol><li>There would be little to no duplicate apps.  Any app that appeared to be a duplicate must have had some important must-have feature(s) that I could not live without.
</li></ol>
<p>The Changes</p>
<p>With the ground rules established, I thought about what I use my phone for.  It is my primary email device.  I read and surf the web on it.  It is my camera and my music player.  It is my window into Facebook and Twitter. I use it to write and design blogposts (such as this one), and I occasionally sketch on it.</p>

<p>For email, I decided to use only the stock iOS Mail app and delete the others.  I was never happy with the font rendering in GMail's iOS app, nor in Mailbox's, and with regards to Mailbox, I was never happy with the fact that my email was going through Mailbox's servers.  Furthermore, and this was the biggest factor in my decision, I use more than just GMail.  (Outlook.com is quite nice - leaps and bounds above what Hotmail used to be.) I did not want to constantly check two apps.  If I need to search my vast GMail "All Mail" folder (which happens once in a blue moon),  I will use GMail through Safari.  Speaking of Safari, I like it, it is secure.  Chrome for iOS got the ax.  Chrome for iOS is slower than Safari, and one cannot block third party cookies as one can in Safari.  </p>

<p>For music, I love Spotify on the desktop, but I decided to keep only Pandora for streaming.     I mainly only listen to my music on my phone in shuffle mode no matter what app I'm in, and I just prefer Pandora to the other streaming apps. I decided to delete Amazon's music app and only use the stock Music App for playing downloaded music on my iPhone.</p>

<p>For text editing/note taking, I have chosen to keep a combo of the stock Notes app and iA Writer.  I had <a href="http://theartdirectedjournal.github.io/battle-of-the-text-editors.html">written about these apps before</a> (and had since gone back to using a multitude of different apps).  I like Notes because it is quick and I can get to my notes easily on a Mac or PC using iCloud.com.  I like iA Writer because it has a feature that allows one to copy text as HTML markup, and it syncs with Dropbox really well. This is essential to designing blog posts from my phone.</p>

<p>For the weather, I have chosen to stick with the stock Weather widget.  Also among the stock iOS apps that I continue to prefer and use exclusively are Calendar, Reminders, Calculator, Messages,  Clock, Photos and Camera.  Sure, there may be more feature rich third party alternatives to each of these apps, but the stock apps suit me well and I know them inside and out.  I also use Apple's Podcasts app, as I find that the recent  improvements to it make it a quite stable, usable app.</p>

<p>The only exception on the aforementioned list pertains to the stock Camera app.  I also use Camera+, but not for actually taking the photo, only for post processing.  Camera+ opens too slowly to capture a quick moment, and I usually access my camera from the lock screen anyway.</p>

<p>I chose to keep Google Maps over the stock Maps app.  The reason behind this is that Google Maps offers turn by turn navigation on my iPhone 3GS where Apple's Maps app does not.  When I get a newer phone, I may revert to the stock app.</p>

<p>Aside from keeping a handful of games that I actually play, that pretty much sums my changes.  I have gone from a measly 100MB free to having 3.7 GB available as of the time of this writing.  My phone is faster, I can enjoy using it, and I can actually find things.  Instead of deciding which app I will use, I just open up my default choice and go.</p>
