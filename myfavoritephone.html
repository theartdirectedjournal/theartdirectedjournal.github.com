<p class="article_title">My Favorite Phone Ever</p>

<p>While the iPhone is a fantastic phone with many capabilities, the Nokia 3395 (3310 in Europe) is perhaps my favorite phone of all time.  It was small (for 2002), and it fit easily into my pocket.  It was simple and intuitive to use, and perhaps most important, it was the first phone that I ever owned that was actually fun to use.  My 3395 was also second to none when it came to durability.  I recall once dropping it by accident into a trashcan with water at the bottom.  I quickly retrieved the phone, took it apart (it was easy to do with its replaceable covers), and dried it out.  It still worked like a champ.</p>

<p>Aside from the durability and ease of use, the 3395 had quite a few notable features.  For starters, there was Snake, a classic time suck, as well as a pretty decent pinball game.  There was also a calendar, which I regularly used.  The keypad was also fantastic for texting. One of my very favorite features of this phone was a built-in ringtone composer.  Using this composer app, once could create their own ringtones, and there were several sites dedicated to this.</p>
